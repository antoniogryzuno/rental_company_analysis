#Top 5 Customers Info 

Here I used to type the following commands: 
SELECT 
A.customer_id, 
A.first_name, 
A.last_name, 
D.country, 
C.city, 
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid 
FROM 
customer A  
JOIN 
Address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
JOIN 
City C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
JOIN 
Country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
JOIN 
Payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id 
WHERE 
D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan',  
GROUP BY 
'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Phillippines', 
'Turkey', 'Indonesia') 
A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city 
ORDER BY 
total_amount_paid DESC 
LIMIT 5;
